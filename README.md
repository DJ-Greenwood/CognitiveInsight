# Insightâ„¢ - Cryptographic Audit Framework

**Patent-Pending | In Early Development**

Turn Confusion to Clarity

From excessive data streams to unknown AI black-box structures, our patent-pending audit technology delivers provable compliance â€” on demand.

## The Challenge

AI/ML pipelines generate overwhelming volumes of logs and outputs â€” often stored without structure or clear lineage. In regulated industries, this creates two big problems:

- **Excessive Audit Overhead** â€“ Every event is logged "just in case," wasting storage and compute.
- **Opaque AI Decisions** â€“ Model outputs can't always be explained or verified.

This leaves organizations exposed to compliance risk, costly investigations, and damaged trust.

## Our Solution: Insightâ„¢

Insightâ„¢ is our cryptographic audit framework that applies **selective, on-demand proof generation** to the compliance challenge:

- **On-Demand Proof Generation** â€“ Audit evidence is created only when needed, without sacrificing integrity.
- **Provenance-Chain Anchoring** â€“ Verifies that data hasn't been altered â€” even across millions of events.
- **Trigger-Based Materialization** â€“ Switches from lazy to eager logging instantly when a compliance event occurs.
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption** â€“ Protects sensitive data while still enabling verification.

The result? Instant, verifiable audits with up to **90% lower storage costs** and **1000x faster data registration**.

## Industries We're Targeting

*All industry implementations are currently under development*

- **Healthcare** â€“ HIPAA-compliant patient data audits without storing every raw record. *(Under Development)*
- **Finance** â€“ SEC/FINRA-ready proofs without constant logging overhead. *(Under Development)*
- **Defense** â€“ Real-time auditability in classified AI/ML pipelines. *(Under Development)*
- **AI Governance** â€“ Explainability and trust for black-box models. *(Under Development)*
- **IoT & Edge Devices** â€“ Lightweight audit proofs for sensors and field systems. *(Under Development)*
- **Energy & Critical Infrastructure** â€“ Compliance and event integrity in CISA-regulated environments. *(Under Development)*

## Get Started

This is a Next.js application built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
