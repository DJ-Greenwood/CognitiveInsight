                                We originally built the Insightâ„¢ framework to track AI/ML pipelines and ensure clear lineage for all pipeline components.

                                In practice, we discovered a powerful side effect: by generating verifiable receipts instead of storing every raw log, the system dramatically reduced storage requirements and accelerated audit preparation.

                                What began as a transparency tool for AI builders has become a breakthrough in both operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.
